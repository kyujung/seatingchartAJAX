Classroom seating web application(Rails)
created by Cesar Acosta and Maksim Surguy, May 2011

Usage:
Create a user
Log in with the new user

To take an available seat in the classroom, just click on any Vacant seat.
To send a chat message to everyone in the class, type in a message under "Backchannel" and hit "Add Message"

The messages are filtered to be shown for only the past three hours but all of the messages are saved in a database (in case the teacher wants to check the conversation later)


To remove the current student from the class (to not take up any seats) click "Remove from class"

This Rails app uses gem "nifty_generators" for authentication and scaffolding templates (this beautiful gem is from Railscasts.com author Ryan Bates )
to install the nifty_generators gem do the following command:
sudo gem install nifty_generators

we check if the user is logged in by simple check :
  "if logged_in?" 
and the current user's details are available : current_user.username ,etc
